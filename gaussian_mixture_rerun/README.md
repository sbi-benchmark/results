# Gaussian Mixture Rerun

[`sbibm` v1.1.0 fixed a bug in the Gaussian Mixture task](https://github.com/sbi-benchmark/sbibm/releases/tag/v1.1.0). We reran the Gaussian Mixture task to quantify the effect:

For comparison, the results reported in the paper:

Note that the new results were obtained with different random seeds and an updated version of `sbi`. They are also available through `results/gaussian_mixture_rerun.csv`.
